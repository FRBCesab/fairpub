## Overview

Scientific journals operate over a broad spectrum of publishing
strategies, from strictly for-profit, to non-profit, and in-between
business models (e.g. for-profit but academic friendly journals).
Scientific publishing is increasingly dominated by for-profit journals,
many of which attract prestige and submissions through high impact
factors (McGill 2024). In contrast, non-profit journals – those that
reinvest revenue into the academic community – struggle to maintain
visibility despite offering more equitable publishing models.

The R package `fairpub` aims to provide a user-friendly toolbox to
investigate the fairness of a research (article, bibliographic list,
citation list, etc.). The fairness is measured according to two
dimensions:

- the **business model** of the journal: for-profit vs. non-profit
- the **academic friendly** status of the journal: yes or no

A journal with a non-profit business model is fairer than an academic
friendly journal with a for-profit business model. But the later is
still fairer than a non-academic friendly journal with a for-profit
business model.

This information comes from the [DAFNEE
initiative](https://dafnee.isem-evolution.fr/), a Database of Academia
Friendly jourNals in Ecology and Evolution.

The package `fairpub` also implements the method proposed by Beck *et
al.* (in prep): the strategic citation. By deliberately choosing to cite
relevant articles from non-profit journals when multiple references
would be equally valid, researchers can contribute to increasing their
visibility and future impact factor. This method is implemented in the
`fp_compute_ratio()` function and can answer the question **How fair am
I when I cite previous works?** by computing the fairness ratio on the
references cited in a manuscript.

The package can also answer the question **How fair is my publication
list?**. See the [Get
started](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/articles/fairpub.html)
vignette for more information.

## Features

The `fairpub` package can:

- retrieve the fairness status of a journal with the
  [`fp_journal_fairness()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_journal_fairness.html)
  function
- retrieve the fairness status of an article with the
  [`fp_article_fairness()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_article_fairness.html)
  function and by querying the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org)
  bibliographic database
- compute the fairness ratio of a list references cited in a manuscript
  with the
  [`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html)
  function
- compute the fairness ratio of all publications of an author (or a
  team) with the
  [`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html)
  function

In addition, the
[`fp_doi_from_bibtex()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_doi_from_bibtex.html)
function helps user to easily extract DOI from a BibTeX file. The list
of DOI can then be pass to the
[`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html)
function.

## Limitation

The package `fairpub` provides a small subset of the journals indexed in
the [DAFNEE database](https://dafnee.isem-evolution.fr/) (fields
“Ecology”, “Evolution/Systematics”, “General” and “Organisms”). We are
currently working to increase this list of journals.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Install < remotes > package (if not already installed) ----
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install < fairpub > from GitHub ----
remotes::install_github("frbcesab/fairpub")
```

Then you can attach the package `fairpub`:

``` r
library("fairpub")
```

## Get started

The main function of `fairpub` is
[`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html).
From a vector of article DOI, this function will report the following
metrics:

``` r
fp_compute_ratio(doi = list_of_doi)
```

    ## $summary
    ##                                     metric value
    ##                           Total references    33
    ##                        References with DOI    33
    ##                    Deduplicated references    33
    ##               References found in OpenAlex    30
    ##                 References found in DAFNEE    10
    ##     Non-profit & acad. friendly references     9
    ##     For-profit & acad. friendly references     1
    ## For-profit & non-acad. friendly references     0
    ## 
    ## $ratios
    ## Non-profit & acad. friendly  For-profit & acad. friendly  For-profit & non-acad. friendly 
    ##                         0.9                          0.1                              0.0 

In this example, this list of references has a fairness ratio
(`Non-profit and academic friendly`) of 90%. But this value must be
interpreted with caution. Indeed this ratio has been computed on 26% (10
over 38) of the references, because the journal of 20 articles is not
indexed in the DAFNEE database.
